# Final Copy

Above is the final copy of my code.

The "RMIT Creative Coding Specialisation" is given the same colour as the background in order to viewed only when there is a shape created behind it. I believe this to be a good representation of effective complexity. This is due to the shapes being created seem to be very uncontrolled. However, in a way the shapes are still in control as well as are important as without them the "RMIT Creative Coding Specialisation" text can not be seen.
