# Trail Idea

For my code I wanted more of an effect for the circles moving. So I found a very simple yet effective method to create a trail effect. The discovered the trail effect while browsing through the p5 example library.

By implementing the trail effect to my code I was able to elevate the visual aspect of the circles moving tremendously. To further increase the visual appeal I added different colours for each player so that the trails will all be different.

Images were also added to further personalise the circles with each player.
