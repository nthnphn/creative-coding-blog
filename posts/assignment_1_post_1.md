# Morphing Idea

[p5 Example: Morph](https://p5js.org/examples/motion-morph.html)

The code above was what inspired me to create the main feature of my net art. 
As I was scrolling through examples that p5 gives I came across this example of morphing shapes.

When I saw the example of a square morphing into a circle, I came up with an idea on how to incorporate it with effective complexity. And that was to create different random shapes very fast.
