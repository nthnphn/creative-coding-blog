# Jumping forwards and backwards

I still needed to incorporate the deaths and assist of each player into my code. The way I incorporated the deaths and assist is that they would both be changed into a percentage on whether or not the circles will jump backwards or forwards. 


This idea actually came from the board game [Snakes and Ladders](https://toytheater.com/snakes-and-ladders/). The circles moving reminded me of the game snake which then allowed me to simnilary copy the board game snakes and ladders. The board game contains players moving throughout the board, however if they land on a snake they will move backwards, and if they land on a ladder they move forwards. 

In this case the circles of the players will be jumping backwards or forwards depending on their deaths and assist.

By implementing this, I am able to imply that dying causes problems (returns you backwards) while getting assist benefit you (jumps you forward)
