# Moving Circles

At the early stages of the assignment I knew what I wanted my community of practice to be however I was unsure of how to implement it into a code. After have a chat with my Creative Coding teacher Thomas as well as looking for inspiration, I wanted the code to show some sort of competition.

[CIRLCE ANIMATION](https://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2021/spring/11111-1/happycoding/p5js/animation.html)

The link above is a website where I was inspired to create circles moving across the screen as if it was a race. Which sort of shows a form of competition similar to the value for my community of practice.

I thought this idea was interesting to implement because despite how simple the animation may seem, I was able to see many different possibilities of how it could be used and implemented in my code.

With the help of the website I was able to implement moving circles in my p5.js editor

By using a constructor, I was able to create the circles based on the players individuals statistics. The combat score represented the size of the circle and the amount of kills represented the speed of the circles
